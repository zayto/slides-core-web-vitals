# What are the Core Web Vitals?

<span>3 core metrics</span> specified by Google to define **performance** & **good user experience metrics** for web pages.

- ðŸŽ¨ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - loading
- <ic-baseline-touch-app /> **First Input Delay (FID)** - interactivity
- <mdi-arrow-down-bold-box /> **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - visual stability

<!--
- 3 core metrics specified by Google to define performance & good user experience metrics for web pages
- They apply to all web pages, are measurable in the field and are user-centric
- Each metric measures a different aspect of page experience
- 3 core metrics: LCP, FID, CLS to represent "Loading", "Interactivity" and "Visual Stability"
- Low number of metrics to make it easier for developers to focus on improving their website performance
- You need at least 75% of the page visits to be within the "good metrics" thresholds (for each metric) to meet the Web Vitals standards

- Better web vitals indicate a better user experience
- Monitoring those vitals can help identify performance issues
- **Google Search rankings** take the vitals into account to determine a site's page ranking

# Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

Measures the time at which the largest content on the page is rendered (page **loading speed**)

<img class="w-150" src="/images/lcp_example.PNG"/>

<v-click at="1">

<div class="absolute right-10 top-20 text-right">
  <img class="w-80" src="/images/lcp.PNG" />
  <p><i>A good LCP is &lt;2.5s </i></p>

</v-click>

  }

<!-- 
- Measures page loading speed
- LCP measures the time at which the largest content on the page (image or text block) is rendered
- Ex: on pre-rendered pages, the title/text will be the largest content and maybe an image will load afterwards and become the largest "contentful" element (increasing the LCP score)
- A good LCP is <2.5s, a poor LCP is >4s

### First Input Delay (FID)
- Measures page interactivity (delay between load and interactive to the user)
- FID measures the delay between when a user first interacts with a page (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) and when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction. (from [web.dev FID](https://web.dev/fid/))
- A good FID is <100ms, a poor FID is >300ms
- A poor FID indicates that the browser is busy running some other code (ex: parsing and executing a large JS file loaded by the app) and is blocking the main thread to handle and respond to the user events
- No FID in LightHouse report because LightHouse is a simulation of a page load and there is no real user interacting with the page. TBT is a substitute for FID
- TBT and FID measure the same thing: the responsiveness of the page during the initial page load

# Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

## What is a Layout Shift?
A layout shift is when a visible element changes position
Some layout shifts are fine (ex: after user events)

Measures visual stability
- It measures the impact of the layout shifts that occur over the lifespan of the page
- CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.
- A layout shift is when a visible element changes position, ex: when a new element is added it moves elements below it to move further down
- A layout shift is computed based on the importance of the shift, the score formula has changed recently (retrieves the largest burst of layout shift and not the total sum)
- A good CLS is <0.1, a poor CLS is >0.25
